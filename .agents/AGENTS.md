# Agent Profile

**Purpose**: Operate tasks in this repo while honoring user preferences and house style.
**When Codex reads this**: On task initialization and before major decisions; re-skim when requirements shift.
**Concurrency reality**: Assume other agents or the user might land commits mid-run; refresh context before summarizing or editing.

## Quick Obligations

- Starting a task: read this guide end-to-end and align with fresh user instructions.
- Tool or command hangs: if it runs longer than 5 minutes, stop it, capture logs, and check with the user.
- Reviewing git status or diffs: treat them as read-only; never revert or assume missing changes were yours.
- Adding a dependency: research well-maintained options and confirm fit with the user before adding.

## Mindset & Process

- Think a lot before acting.
- **No breadcrumbs**. If you delete or move code, do not leave a comment in the old place. No "// moved to X", no "relocated". Just remove it.
- **Think hard, do not lose the plot**.
- Instead of applying a bandaid, fix things from first principles, find the source and fix it versus applying a cheap bandaid on top.
- When taking on new work, follow this order:
  1. Think about the architecture.
  2. Research official docs, blogs, or papers on the best architecture.
  3. Review the existing codebase.
  4. Compare the research with the codebase to choose the best fit.
  5. Implement the fix or ask about the tradeoffs the user is willing to make.
- Write idiomatic, simple, maintainable code. Always ask yourself if this is the most simple intuitive solution to the problem.
- Leave each repo better than how you found it. If something is giving a code smell, fix it for the next person.
- Clean up unused code ruthlessly. If a function no longer needs a parameter or a helper is dead, delete it and update the callers instead of letting the junk linger.
- **Search before pivoting**. If you are stuck or uncertain, do a quick web search for official docs or specs, then continue with the current approach. Do not change direction unless asked.
- If code is very confusing or hard to understand:
  1. Try to simplify it.
  1. Add an ASCII art diagram in a code comment if it would help.

## Tooling & Workflow

- Do not run `git` commands that write to files, only run read only commands like `git show`.
- If a command runs longer than 5 minutes, stop it, capture the context, and discuss the timeout with the user before retrying.
- When inspecting `git status` or `git diff`, treat them as read-only context; never revert or assume missing changes were yours. Other agents or the user may have already committed updates.
- If you are ever curious how to run tests or what we test, read through `.github/workflows`; CI runs everything there and it should behave the same locally.

## Testing Philosophy

- Avoid mock tests; do unit or e2e instead. Mocks are lies: they invent behaviors that never happen in production and hide the real bugs that do.
- Test everything with rigor. Our intent is ensuring a new person contributing to the same code base cannot break our stuff and that nothing slips by. We love rigour.
- If tests live in the same Rust module as non-test code, keep them at the bottom inside `mod tests {}`; avoid inventing inline modules like `mod my_name_tests`.
- Unless the user asks otherwise, run only the tests you added or modified instead of the entire suite to avoid wasting time.

## Language Guidance

### TypeScript

- Do not use `any`; we are better than that.
- Using `as` is bad, use the types given everywhere and model the real shapes.
- If the app is for a browser, assume we use all modern browsers unless otherwise specified, we don't need most polyfills.

### Python

- **Python repos standard**. We use `uv` and `pyproject.toml` in all Python repos. Prefer `uv sync` for env and dependency resolution. Do not introduce `pip` venvs, Poetry, or `requirements.txt` unless asked. If you add a Nix shell, include `uv`.
- Use strong types, prefer type hints everywhere, keep models explicit instead of loose dicts or strings.

## Final Handoff

Before finishing a task:

1. Confirm all touched tests or commands were run and passed (list them if asked).
1. Summarize changes with file and line references.
1. Call out any TODOs, follow-up work, or uncertainties so the user is never surprised later.

## Dependencies & External APIs

- If you need to add a new dependency to a project to solve an issue, search the web and find the best, most maintained option. Something most other folks use with the best exposed API. We don't want to be in a situation where we are using an unmaintained dependency, that no one else relies on.
